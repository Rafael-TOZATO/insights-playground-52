## Dashboard architecture
- Use deterministic local financial mock records and derive every KPI, chart, table and CSV from the same filtered records to keep analyses consistent.
- Keep the three content routes on a shared dashboard presentation module with semantic CSS tokens so visual changes remain consistent across views.
